      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The <B>Income Statement</B>, also 
      called the Profit and Loss Statement, shows how much money a business 
      makes or loses over a specific time period - a month, 3 months, 6 months 
      or a year.&nbsp; Income statements are prepared monthly, quarterly and 
      annually, but never cover a period longer than a year.&nbsp; When income 
      statements are prepared, management or its accountants extract sales and 
      other income totals along with totals of various expenses from internal 
      accounting records.&nbsp; Once expenses are computed, they are subtracted 
      from income and either a profit or loss is shown.&nbsp; The results on the 
      income statement affect the balance sheet from period to period, so it is 
      important to review both statements to determine the full impact each has 
      on the other.</FONT> 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B><I>Net sales</I></B> is 
        derived by adding up the total invoices billed to customers during the 
        period covered, less any discounts taken by customers.&nbsp; Then, any 
        sales returns accepted from customers during the period are 
        deducted.&nbsp; After deductions are made, the remaining figure is net 
        sales.</FONT> 
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Gross profit is net sales less 
        the cost of goods sold.&nbsp; Cost of goods sold includes expenses 
        required to manufacture, purchase merchandise and service 
        customers.&nbsp; The cost of goods sold takes in material costs, labor 
        and factory expenses involved in producing merchandise.</FONT> 
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B><I>Net profit</I></B> after 
        tax (or net income after tax) is gross profit less all expenses directly 
        applicable to the company's operations, including income taxes.&nbsp; 
        Net profit after tax truly measures the operating success of the 
        company.&nbsp; When total expenses exceed net sales, a minus figure 
        results and a loss has occurred.&nbsp; If there is a surplus (profit), 
        it can be added to retained earnings or distributed to owners and 
        stockholders as withdrawals or dividends.&nbsp; When expenses exceed net 
        sales (when a loss occurs), it is charged against net worth and a 
        reduction in the equity account occurs.</FONT> 
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B><I>Working capital</I></B> 
        represents the funds available to finance current business 
        operations.&nbsp; This figure is important as it is used to determine 
        how much excess cash a business has to fund current expenses.&nbsp; 
        Working capital is the difference between current assets and current 
        liabilities.&nbsp; Since a company's sources to pay its current debt 
        come partly from current assets, a business with a comfortable margin 
        should be able to pay its bills and operate successfully.&nbsp; How much 
        working capital is enough depends on the proportion of current assets to 
        current liabilities rather than on the dollar amount of working 
        capital.&nbsp;</FONT>
