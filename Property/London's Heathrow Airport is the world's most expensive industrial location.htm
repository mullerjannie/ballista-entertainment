<P class=greyheading>London's Heathrow Airport is the world's most expensive 
industrial location</P>
<P class=normal></P><SPAN class=normal>
<P>London's Heathrow Airport is the world's most expensive industrial location 
according to Business Space Across the World, the annual report by international 
property consultant Healey &amp; Baker and its global partner Cushman &amp; 
Wakefield.</P>
<P>Heathrow's total occupancy cost (rent, plus property taxes and service 
charge) stands at euro 274 per sq m, while second-placed San Francisco's is euro 
265 per sq m. Heathrow rental values increased by 17% over the year but San 
Francisco's saw a dramatic fall of 57%.</P>
<P>The main movers in the league table were Tel Aviv and Paris, which moved from 
9th to 4th place and 20th to 8th, respectively. The key reason for their rise 
was the stability of rents in these locations compared with falls in rents in 
many of the top 10 most expensive centres.</P>
<P>David Hutchings, Head of the European Research Group at Healey &amp; Baker 
said:</P>
<P>"Although many markets remained relatively healthy in 2001, they were unable 
to reach the heights of the previous year. Overall, this meant a -4.9% decline 
in rental levels across the locations surveyed as the distribution and 
warehousing market settled back.</P>
<P>"The telecoms industry that had dominated the sector in 2000 saw a sharp 
global decline and this along with the global economic slowdown and the decline 
in manufacturing was instrumental in the industrial sector's downturn.</P>
<P>"By contrast, the logistics sector has remained buoyant, fuelled by increases 
in rationalisation and outsourcing. While this has created more interest in 
bigger units with good transport links this has also in part caused a growing 
amount of smaller and older space to languish on the market."</P>
<P>Other main findings for the world's top industrial locations:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Europe</LI></UL>
<P>* While rental levels on aggregate in Europe declined last year (-3.8%), the 
falls were less severe than the global average.</P>
<P>* Zurich lies behind London Heathrow as Europe's second most expensive 
industrial location and the world's third./more</P>
<P>* Central and Eastern Europe performed marginally better than Western Europe 
with strong growth in Russia and a stable situation in the Czech Republic and 
Hungarian industrial markets.</P>
<P>* While there were still areas of growth in France, Austria, Belgium, Italy 
and the UK, they were counter-balanced by steep falls in Turkey, Ireland and 
most of Scandinavia.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Middle East &amp; Africa</LI></UL>
<P>* The Middle East &amp; Africa region outperformed the global average in 2001 
with rental growth of 3%.</P>
<P>* Tel Aviv is now the fourth most expensive industrial location in the 
world.</P>
<P>* The South African market saw rental levels grow by 6% but it remains the 
most competitive region in the world for occupying industrial space.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Americas</LI></UL>
<P>* The US industrial market slowed over 2001, experiencing a fall in rents of 
-32%. This was primarily due to a combined fall in San Francisco and San Jose as 
a result of the faltering TMT sector</P>
<P>* Despite this, there were still some areas of growth, notably Denver which 
saw the highest rental growth with rents increasing by 15% to euro72 per sq 
m.</P>
<P>* The Canadian market eased over 2001, with Montreal showing the country's 
best performance</P>
<P>* The Central and South American markets were affected by the area's 
political and economic uncertainty. Rents in Argentina rents saw the steepest 
fall at -20%, while there was softening in rents in Brazil (-8%) and Mexico 
(-2%).</P>
