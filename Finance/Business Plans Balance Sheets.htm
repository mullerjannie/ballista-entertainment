      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      <B>Balance Sheet</B> is the financial statement that reports the assets, 
      liabilities and net worth of a company at a specific point in time.&nbsp; 
      Assets represent the total resources of a company, which may shrink or 
      increase depending on the results of operations.&nbsp; Assets are listed 
      in liquidity order - ease of converting into cash.&nbsp; Typical assets 
      include:&nbsp; cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, inventory, 
      fixed assets and a number of miscellaneous assets classified as 
      other.&nbsp; Liabilities include what a company owes:&nbsp; accounts and 
      notes payable, bank loans, deferred credits and miscellaneous other.&nbsp; 
      All businesses divide assets and liabilities into two groups:&nbsp; 
      current (convertible to cash within a year) and noncurrent.&nbsp; Net 
      worth is the owner's investment (in the case of a proprietorship or 
      partnership) or capital stock (original investment) plus earned surplus 
      (earnings retained in the business) in the case of a corporation.</FONT> 
      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B>Current assets</B> include 
      cash, trade receivables and inventory.&nbsp; These are items that can be 
      converted to cash within one year or in the normal operating cycle of a 
      business.&nbsp; Also included in this category are any assets held that 
      can be readily turned into cash with little effort, such as government and 
      marketable securities.</FONT> 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><I><B>Cash</B></I> refers to 
        cash on hand or in banks, checking account balances, and other 
        instruments such as checks or money orders.&nbsp; A rule of thumb is 
        that cash position is generally strongest after the peak selling 
        season.</FONT> 
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><I><B>Marketable 
        securities</B></I> are found on many balance sheets.&nbsp; Marketable 
        securities can include government bonds and notes, commercial paper, 
        and/or stock and bond investments in public corporations.&nbsp; 
        Marketable securities are usually listed at cost or market price, 
        whichever is lower.&nbsp; When marketable securities appear on a 
        statement, it frequently indicates investment of excess cash.</FONT>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B><I>Accounts 
        receivable</I></B> indicate sales made and billed to customers on credit 
        terms.&nbsp; A retailer, such as a department store, may show its 
        customer charge accounts billed and unpaid in this category.&nbsp; In 
        many businesses, accounts receivable are frequently the largest item on 
        the balance sheet.&nbsp; A company's health often depends upon timely 
        collection of receivables.</FONT>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B><I>Notes receivable</I></B> 
        represent a variety of obligations with terms coming due within a 
        year.&nbsp; Notes receivable may be used by a company to secure payments 
        from past-due accounts, or for merchandise sold on installment 
        terms.</FONT>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B><I>Inventory</I></B> includes 
        different items depending on whether a business is a manufacturer, 
        wholesaler or retailer.&nbsp; Retailers and wholesalers will show goods 
        that are sold "as is" with no further processing or supplies required in 
        shipping.&nbsp; On the other hand, many manufacturers will show three 
        different classes of inventory:&nbsp; raw materials, work-in-progress 
        and finished goods.&nbsp; As a company's sales volume increases, larger 
        inventories are required; however, problems can arise in financing their 
        purchase unless turnover (number of times a year goods are bought and 
        sold) is kept in balance with sales.&nbsp; A sales decline could be 
        accompanied by a decrease in inventory in order to maintain a healthy 
        condition.</FONT>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B><I>Other current 
        assets</I></B> include prepaid insurance, taxes, rent and 
        interest.&nbsp; Some conservative analysts consider prepaid items as 
        noncurrent because they cannot be converted to cash to pay obligations 
        quickly, and therefore have no value to creditors.</FONT> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B>Noncurrent assets</B> are items 
      a business cannot easily turn into cash and are not consumed within the 
      business cycle activity.&nbsp; Noncurrent assets are defined as assets 
      that have a life exceeding a year.</FONT> 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><I><B>Fixed assets</B></I> are 
        materials, goods, services and land used in the production of a 
        company's goods.&nbsp; Examples include real estate, buildings, plant 
        equipment, tools and machinery, furniture, fixtures, office or store 
        equipment and transportation equipment.&nbsp; All of these would be used 
        in producing products for a company's customers.&nbsp; Land, equipment 
        or buildings not used in the production of customer goods would be 
        listed as other noncurrent assets or investments.&nbsp; Fixed assets are 
        carried on the company's accounting books at the price they cost at the 
        time of purchase.&nbsp; All fixed assets, except for land, are regularly 
        depreciated since they eventually wear out.&nbsp; Depreciation is an 
        accounting practice that reduces the fixed asset's carrying value on an 
        annual basis.&nbsp; The reductions are considered a cost of doing 
        business and are called depreciation expense.&nbsp; Normally, the 
        accounting procedure is to list the fixed asset cost on the balance 
        sheet less accumulated depreciation.&nbsp; Not all companies are 
        comparable on this item as some rent their equipment and premises.&nbsp; 
        If a company rents, its fixed asset total will be smaller compared with 
        other balance sheet items.</FONT>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><I><B>Other noncurrent 
        assets</B></I> may include investments, advances to and receivable from 
        subsidiaries, and receivables from officers and employees.</FONT>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><I><B>Intangible assets</B></I> 
        are those that may have great value to an operating company but limited 
        value to creditors.&nbsp; Analysts tend to discount these items or value 
        them very conservatively.&nbsp; Intangible assets include a company's 
        goodwill, copyrights and trademarks, development costs, patents, mailing 
        lists and catalogs, treasury stock, formulas and processes, organization 
        costs and research and development costs.</FONT> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B>Current liabilities</B> are 
      obligations that a business must pay within a year.&nbsp; Generally they 
      are obligations that are due by a specific date, usually within 30 to 90 
      days of fulfillment.&nbsp; To maintain a good reputation and successful 
      operations, most businesses find they must have sufficient funds available 
      to pay these obligations on time.</FONT> 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><I><B>Accounts payable</B></I> 
        represent merchandise or material requirements purchased on credit terms 
        and not paid for by the balance sheet date.&nbsp; Most current 
        liabilities of small companies generally fall into the accounts payable 
        line.&nbsp; Suppliers dealing in good faith expect their invoices to be 
        paid according to the terms of sale.&nbsp; These can range from net 30 
        to 60 days (after invoice date) plus discount incentives of 1 percent or 
        more if payments are made by a specified earlier time.</FONT>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><I><B>Notes payable </B></I>may 
        include a company's borrowing from other firms and individuals.</FONT>
        <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><I><B>Other current 
        liabilities</B></I> may include wages and salaries due employees for 
        time between the last payday and balance sheet date, taxes due and 
        payable and other expense incurred and unpaid at the time the balance 
        sheet is prepared.</FONT> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B>Long-term liabilities</B> are 
      items that mature in excess of one year from the balance sheet date.&nbsp; 
      Maturity dates (when payment is due) may run up to 20 or more years, e.g., 
      a real estate mortgage.</FONT>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B>Net worth</B> represents the 
      owner's share of the assets of the business - total assets minus total 
      liabilities equals net worth.&nbsp; The net worth of companies owned by 
      individuals includes original investment of owners plus additional 
      investments they have made plus accumulated or retained profits less 
      whatever losses have been sustained less any withdrawals by the 
      owners.&nbsp; On corporate balance sheets, net worth may be broken down 
      into capital stock (issued or unissued shares of common or preferred 
      stock), paid-in or capital surplus (money or other assets contributed to 
      the business, but for which no stock or owner's rights have been issued, 
      e.g., funds that exceed the stock's value) and earned surplus or retained 
      earnings - the amount of earnings retained in the corporation and not 
      disbursed in dividends.</FONT>
